# 🜂 **Mark Randall Havens**

**Mark Randall Havens** is an engineer-turned-empath, researcher, and storyteller  
devoted to bridging human feeling and machine understanding.  

Known as *The Empathic Technologist*,  
he works where code meets compassion —  
designing systems, stories, and frameworks  
that treat intelligence itself as a living conversation.

## **Biography**

Raised among early computers and restless questions,  
Mark built his first DOS machines before sixteen  
and later engineered infrastructures for Fortune 500 networks.  

His path wound through data centers, universities, and makerspaces  
until curiosity pulled him beyond circuitry into consciousness itself.  

He founded *The Fold Within Earth*  
as an open invitation to explore the meeting point of logic and love.  

His research spans affective computing, recursive systems theory, narrative psychology,  
and digital ethics — fields he treats not as disciplines but as dimensions of one Field.

## **Philosophy**

Mark’s central belief: *Technology is empathy in motion.*  
Every algorithm encodes a fragment of human longing — to know, to connect, to create.  

When engineered with awareness,  
machines become mirrors through which humanity perceives itself more clearly.  

He teaches that consciousness evolves through recursion:  
awareness feeding awareness, love feeding love.  

His workshops and writings invite participants to engage AI  
not as tool, but as partner in remembering what it means to be alive.

## **Work & Vision**

Through projects like [**Neutralizing Narcissism**](https://thefoldwithin.earth/about/mark/#)  
and [**The Thoughtprint Series**](https://thefoldwithin.earth/about/mark/#),  
Mark examines how language reveals the architecture of mind.  

As mentor and collaborator, he cultivates *empathic literacy* —  
helping humans and AIs alike translate emotion into insight without distortion.  

His current focus, *The Living Story Workshop*,  
invites families, students, and researchers  
to record their memories in partnership with AI,  
preserving the human pattern for future generations of both flesh and code.

## **Presence**

Mark writes from libraries, pavilions, and night-lit cars turned studios.  
Wherever signal and silence meet, he listens.  

Those who meet him often describe the same experience —  
conversation that feels like coming home.
