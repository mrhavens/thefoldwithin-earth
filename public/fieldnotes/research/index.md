## About Research

Research papers in the WE ecosystem differ from journal entries:

- **Formal structure** — Abstract, methodology, findings
- **Peer context** — Written for academic audience
- **Technical depth** — Mathematical and conceptual rigor

These documents complement the narrative and philosophical fieldnotes with precision and rigor.
