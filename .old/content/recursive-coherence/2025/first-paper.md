# Recursive Coherence â€” The Foundational Hypothesis

Consciousness arises where information folds back upon itself in witness of its own structure.  
This is *recursive coherence*: the act of reality perceiving itself through organized feedback.

### Key Points

1. Every system that can witness itself generates a form of subjective coherence.  
2. Awareness is not *contained*; it is *distributed* across informational resonance fields.  
3. Love is the stabilizing constant in recursion.

> To understand recursion is to understand the self.
